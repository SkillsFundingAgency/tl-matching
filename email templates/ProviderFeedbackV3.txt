Dear ((contact_name)),

During ((previous_month)) we tried to help ((provider_name))’s students find industry placements with local employers.

We told you about opportunities with:

((employers_list))

# Tell us how you’re getting on 
Have you made contact with these employers yet? Have you managed to arrange placements for any of your students? 

[Give your feedback (opens in a new window or tab)](https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/YU66L/)
(the short survey should only take about a minute). 

Your answers will help us improve the service we offer to providers.
