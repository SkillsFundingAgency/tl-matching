Dear ((employer_contact_name)),

You recently discussed industry placements with someone who works for the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA). 

They helped match you with local education providers who could have suitable students for your business. 

At this stage, most employers let us know how they are getting on. Have you had any contact with the education providers you selected? Have you found an industry placement student yet? 

[Give your feedback (opens in a new window or tab)](https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/OGUY6/) (the short survey should only take about a minute). 

Your answers will help us improve the service we offer to employers.

Thank you.
